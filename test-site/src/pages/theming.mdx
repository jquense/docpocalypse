# Theming

Docpocalypse is designed to allow quick bootstraping and developement of documentation sites.
It comes, Docpocalypsecomes configured with [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility first
CSS framework. The "batteries included" makes for an excellent fit for building beautiful sites quickly.

## Extending the default theme

The default Docpocalypse theme is basically just the default tailwind thing with some pre-picked
values for the major theme components (side bar, nav bar, etc).
Nothing is set in stone, and can be easily adjusted. To begin create
a `tailwind.config.js` in the root of your docs site and add it to the gatsby-config.js

```js title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: '@docpocalypse/gatsby-theme',
      options: {
        tailwindConfig: require.resolve('./tailwind.config'),
      }
    }
    ...
  ]
};
```

Now any configuration in your theme file will be merged into the base theme.

```js title=tailwind.config.js
const defaultTheme = require('tailwindcss/defaultTheme')
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        accent:
      }
    }
  }
};
```

_Check out the excellent tailwind [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme) for general
details about extending, and creating a tailwind theme._

### Customizing built-in components

Beyond tweaking theme variables, you may want to apply specific styles to particular
theme components, such as the `<Navbar>`. Most straightforward way to do this is to

<Shadow /> the component you wish to extend and apply a CSS `className` or `style` prop to
the original component. This approach works great for Bring Your Own CSS Framework situations,
or when you want to use a component based CSS-in-JS option.

For folks that prefer a more tailwind-esque approach, each major theme component can
be styled via the tailwind theme using a CSS object syntax.

```js title='./tailwind.config.js'
module.exports = {
  ...
  Navbar: t => ({
    color: t('colors.gray.800'),
    backgroundColor: t('colors.blue.200'),

    // can also target nested components
    '& a:visited': {
      color: t('colors.blue.400'),
    }
  })
};
```

## Disabling tailwind

If tailwind isn't you cup of tea, you can opt-out of any extra tailwind utilties or styles
by configuring a `minimal` theming setup.

```js title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: '@docpocalypse/gatsby-theme',
      options: {
        theming: 'minimal',
        tailwindConfig: require.resolve('./tailwind.config'),
      }
    }
    ...
  ]
};
```

When set to `minimal` (vs `full`) docpocalypse will only use the the theme for it's own
components and not output any general or global css classes. You can still
customize the `tailwind.config.js` to style and tweak the doc theme, or <Shadow /> the
components and use your own styling solution.

## Custom theming solutions

Docpocalypse supports which CSS, or CSS-in-JS styling solution you wish. Via the
gatsby plugins ecosystem, you can setup and configure any number of solutions such
as Sass, Styled Components, PostCSS, etc.

## Syntax Highlighting

Docpocalypse uses `prism-react-renderer` where possible to tokenize and hightlight
displayed code. The simplest way to control which syntax theme is used is
to <Shadow /> the `syntax-theme.ts` file and re-export an existing theme.

```js title=./src/@docpocalypse/gatsby-theme/syntax-theme.js
import nightOwl from '@docpocalypse/gatsby-theme/syntax/night-owl';

export default nightOwl;
```

You export a custom theme as well if none of the existing ones work well.

### Using traditional Prism themes
