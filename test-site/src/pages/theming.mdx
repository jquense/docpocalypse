# Theming

Docpocalypse is designed to allow quick bootstraping and developement of documentation sites.
It comes, Docpocalypsecomes configured with [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility first
CSS framework. The "batteries included" makes for an excellent fit for building beautiful sites quickly.

## Extending the default theme

The default Docpocalypse theme is basically just the default tailwind thing with some pre-picked
values for the major theme components (side bar, nav bar, etc).
Nothing is set in stone, and can be easily adjusted. To begin create
a `tailwind.config.js` in the root of your docs site and add it to the gatsby-config.js

```js title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: '@docpocalypse/gatsby-theme',
      options: {
        tailwindConfig: require.resolve('./tailwind.config'),
      }
    }
    ...
  ]
};
```

Now any configuration in your theme file will be merged into the base theme.

```js title=tailwind.config.js
const defaultTheme = require('tailwindcss/defaultTheme')

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        accent:
      }
    }
  }
};
```

_Check out the excellent tailwind [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme) for general
details about extending, and creating a tailwind theme._

### Customizing built-in components

Beyond tweaking theme variables, you may want to apply specific styles to particular
theme components, such as the `<Navbar>`. Most straightforward way to do this is to

<Shadow /> the component you wish to extend and apply a CSS `className` or `style` prop to
the original component. This approach works great for Bring Your Own CSS Framework situations,
or when you want to use a component based CSS-in-JS option.

For folks that prefer a more tailwind-esque approach, each major theme component can
be styled via the tailwind theme using a CSS object syntax.

To Override the styles of a built-in component, add a style keyed under it's name in your theme.

```js title=./tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  ...
  theme: {
    Navbar: t => ({
      color: t('colors.gray.800'),
      backgroundColor: t('colors.blue.200'),

      // can also target nested components
      '& a:visited': {
        color: t('colors.blue.400'),
      }
    })
  }
};
```

You can also extend the default styles by nesting your style under the `extend` key.

```js title='./tailwind.config.js'
module.exports = {
  ...
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // only change the color
      Navbar: t => ({
        color: t('colors.gray.100'),
      })
    }
  }
};
```

You can also opt out of default styles on a case by case basic by setting the component to `false`.

```js title='./tailwind.config.js'
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // Navbar will be completely unstyled
    Navbar: false,
  },
};
```

## Disabling tailwind

If you want to use tailwind to style your doc, site. you can opt of theming to the degree
that suits your project, by setting the `theming` config in your gatsby config.

### "minimal"

```js title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: '@docpocalypse/gatsby-theme',
      options: {
        theming: 'minimal',
        tailwindConfig: require.resolve('./tailwind.config'),
      }
    }
    ...
  ]
};
```

When set to `minimal` (vs `full`) docpocalypse will only use the the theme for it's own
components and not output any general or global css classes. You can still
customize the `tailwind.config.js` to style and tweak the doc theme, or <Shadow /> the
components and use your own styling solution.

### "none"

When you want to do everything yourself setting themeing to `'none'` will completely
disable and remove any built-in styles. If you choose this option, its because you want to
provide all the styling using your own tools.

## Custom theming solutions

Docpocalypse supports which CSS, or CSS-in-JS styling solution you wish. Via the
gatsby plugins ecosystem, you can setup and configure any number of solutions such
as Sass, Styled Components, PostCSS, etc.

## Syntax Highlighting

Docpocalypse uses `prism-react-renderer` where possible to tokenize and hightlight
displayed code. The simplest way to control which syntax theme is used is
to <Shadow /> the `syntax-theme.ts` file and re-export an existing theme.

```js title=./src/@docpocalypse/gatsby-theme/syntax-theme.js
import nightOwl from '@docpocalypse/gatsby-theme/syntax/night-owl';

export default nightOwl;
```

You export a custom theme as well if none of the existing ones work well.

### Using traditional Prism themes
