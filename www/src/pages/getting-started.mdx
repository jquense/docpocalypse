# Getting Started

Docpocalypse is a suite of packages bundled into a Gatsby theme. Gatsby themes
provide a powerful way to specify site configuration and hide infrastructure
complexity, letting you focus on quickly building documentation sites for projects.

## Setup

Setup is a bit manual at this stage, so let's outline all the necessary steps

### Install

```sh
npm install @docpocalypse/gatsby-theme gatsby
```
